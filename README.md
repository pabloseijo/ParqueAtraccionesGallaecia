# ðŸŽ¢ Gallaecia Amusement Park Application

## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to develop an application for the Gallaecia Amusement Park. This application will include a database to record various elements of the park and a user interface to access and modify these values. The project is implemented in Java, using JDBC for database connectivity and Swing for the graphical user interface.

## Features
- **Database Management**: Efficient handling of park data including rides, ticketing, and visitor information.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate Swing-based GUI for seamless interaction with the park's database.
- **Data Accessibility**: Robust features for adding, updating, and retrieving park information.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- JDBC driver for database connectivity
- Swing library for Java (usually included in standard JDK)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java files in your development environment or using the Java compiler.
3. Run the application.

## Usage
Upon launching the application, users will be greeted with a main menu offering various options to interact with the park's database. From here, users can navigate through different sections such as ride management, ticket bookings, and visitor logs.
